  "description": "The Virtual Brain Inference (VBI) toolkit is an open-source, flexible solution tailored for probabilistic inference on virtual brain models. It integrates computational models with personalized anatomical data to deepen the understanding of brain dynamics and neurological processes. VBI supports fast simulations, comprehensive feature extraction, and employs deep neural density estimators to handle various neuroimaging data types. Its goal is to bridge the gap in solving the inverse problem of identifying control parameters that best explain observed data, thereby making these models applicable for clinical settings. VBI leverages high-performance computing through GPU acceleration and C++ code to ensure efficiency in processing.",
