	abstract = {Current clinical methods often overlook individual variability by relying on population-wide trials, while mechanism-based trials remain underutilized in neuroscience due to the brain{\textquoteright}s complexity. A Virtual Brain Twin (VBT) is a personalized digital replica of an individual{\textquoteright}s brain, integrating structural and functional brain data into advanced computational models and inference algorithms. By bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms, whole-brain dynamics, and imaging data, VBTs enhance the understanding of (patho)physiological mechanisms, advancing insights into both healthy and disordered brain function. Central to VBT is the network modeling that couples mesoscopic representation of neuronal activity through white matter connectivity, enabling the simulation of brain dynamics at a network level. This transformative approach provides interpretable predictive capabilities, supporting clinicians in personalizing treatments and optimizing interventions. This manuscript outlines the key components of VBT development, covering the conceptual, mathematical, technical, and clinical aspects. We describe the stages of VBT construction{\textendash}from anatomical coupling and modeling to simulation and Bayesian inference{\textendash}and demonstrate their applications in resting-state, healthy aging, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, and explore future applications in consciousness research and brain-computer interfaces, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and brain-machine integration.{\textquotedblleft}The brain is conceived as a self-organizing system operating close to instabilities where its activities are governed by collective variables, the order parameters, that enslave the individual parts, i.e., the neurons.{\textquotedblright} Professor Hermann Haken (1927-2024).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.VBTvirtual brain twinTVBthe virtual brainDTIdiffusion tractography imagingDW-MRIdiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imagingCTcomputed tomographyPETpositron emission tomographyBOLDblood-oxygen-level-dependentfMRIfunctional magnetic resonance imagingEEGElectroen-cephalographyMEGMagnetoencephalographySEEGStereoelectroencephalographyiEEGintracranial electroencephalographyECoGElectrocorticographySCstructural connectivityFCfunctional connectivityFCDfunctional connectivity dynamicPSDpower spectral densityNMMNeural mass model},

	abstract = {Network neuroscience has proven essential for understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain (dys)function and cognition. In this context, whole-brain network modeling{\textendash}also known as virtual brain modeling{\textendash}combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node) with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales and across neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations, taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms, enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings. Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data. VBI shows potential to improve hypothesis evaluation in network neuroscience through uncertainty quantification, and contribute to advances in precision medicine by enhancing the predictive power of virtual brain models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.VBIvirtual brain inferenceBOLDblood-oxygen-level-dependentfMRIfunctional magnetic resonance imagingEEGElectroencephalographyMEGMagnetoencephalographysEEGStereoelectroencephalographySCstructural connectivityFCfunctional connectivityFCDfunctional connectivity dynamicPSDpower spectral densitySBIsimulation-based inferenceMAFmasked autoregressive flowNSFneural spline flowMCMCMarkov chain Monte Carlo},
