# GDPR Compliance Statement

The VBI software does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data by itself.  
It is a research tool that can be used locally with user-provided datasets.  

- Any personal or patient-related data used with VBI remain under the full responsibility of the user.  
- VBI does not transfer data to external servers and operates entirely in the local computing environment.  
- We strongly recommend that only anonymised or pseudonymised datasets are used with VBI, in compliance with GDPR principles.  
- Users must ensure that their data handling procedures (storage, preprocessing, and analysis) comply with GDPR and local institutional regulations.  

Thus, VBI is GDPR-compliant as it does not process or distribute personal data on its own.
