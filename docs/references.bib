    abstract = {Surgical interventions in epileptic patients aimed at the removal of the epileptogenic zone have success rates at only 60-70%. This failure can be partly attributed to the insufficient spatial sampling by the implanted intracranial electrodes during the clinical evaluation, leading to an incomplete picture of spatio-temporal seizure organization in the regions that are not directly observed. Utilizing the partial observations of the seizure spreading through the brain network, complemented by the assumption that the epileptic seizures spread along the structural connections, we infer if and when are the unobserved regions recruited in the seizure. To this end we introduce a data-driven model of seizure recruitment and propagation across a weighted network, which we invert using the Bayesian inference framework. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme on a cohort of 45 patients we demonstrate that the method can improve the predictions of the states of the unobserved regions compared to an empirical estimate that does not use the structural information, yet it is on the same level as the estimate that takes the structure into account. Furthermore, a comparison with the performed surgical resection and the surgery outcome indicates a link between the inferred excitable regions and the actual epileptogenic zone. The results emphasize the importance of the structural connectome in the large-scale spatio-temporal organization of epileptic seizures and introduce a novel way to integrate the patient-specific connectome and intracranial seizure recordings in a whole-brain computational model of seizure spread.},

  abstract = {Neuronal interactions are an intricate part of cortical information
	processing generating internal representations of the environment
	beyond simple one-to-one mappings of the input parameter space. Here
	we examined functional ranges of interaction processes within ensembles
	of neurons in cat primary visual cortex. Seven elementary stimuli
	consisting of small squares of light were presented at contiguous
	horizontal positions. The population representation of these stimuli
	was compared to the representation of composite stimuli, consisting
	of two squares of light at varied separations. Based on receptive
	field measurements and by application of an Optimal Linear Estimator,
	the representation of retinal location was constructed as a distribution
	of population activation (DPA) in visual space. The spatiotemporal
	pattern of the DPA was investigated by obtaining the activity of
	each neuron for a sequence of time intervals. We found that the DPA
	of composite stimuli deviates from the superposition of its components
	because of distance-dependent (1) early excitation and (2) late inhibition.
	(3) The shape of the DPA of composite stimuli revealed a distance-dependent
	repulsion effect. We simulated these findings within the framework
	of dynamic neural fields. In the model, the feedforward response
	of neurons is modulated by spatial ranges of excitatory and inhibitory
	interactions within the population. A single set of model parameters
	was sufficient to describe the main experimental effects. Combined,
	our results indicate that the spatiotemporal processing of visual
	stimuli is characterized by a delicate, mutual interplay between
	stimulus-dependent and interaction-based strategies contributing
	to the formation of widespread cortical activation patterns.},

	The network is modeled in terms of a nonlocal integrodifferential
	equation, in which the integral kernel represents the spatial distribution
	of synaptic weights. We show how a spatially periodic modulation
	of homogeneous synaptic connections leads to an effective reduction
	in the speed of a traveling pulse. In the case of large amplitude
	modulations, the traveling pulse represents the envelope of a multibump
	solution, in which individual bumps are nonpropagating and transient.
	The appearance (disappearance) of bumps at the leading (trailing)
	edge of the pulse generates the coherent propagation of the pulse.
	Wave propagation failure occurs when activity is insufficient to
	maintain bumps at the leading edge.},

abstract = {The development of large-scale network models that infer the effective (directed) connectivity among neuronal populations from neuroimaging data represents a key challenge for computational neuroscience. Dynamic causal models (DCMs) of neuroimaging and electrophysiological data are frequently used for inferring effective connectivity but are presently restricted to small graphs (typically up to 10 regions) in order to keep model inversion computationally feasible. Here, we present a novel variant of DCM for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is suited to assess effective connectivity in large (whole-brain) networks. The approach rests on translating a linear DCM into the frequency domain and reformulating it as a special case of Bayesian linear regression. This paper derives regression DCM (rDCM) in detail and presents a variational Bayesian inversion method that enables extremely fast inference and accelerates model inversion by several orders of magnitude compared to classical DCM. Using both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the face validity of rDCM under different settings of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and repetition time (TR) of fMRI data. In particular, we assess the potential utility of rDCM as a tool for whole-brain connectomics by challenging it to infer effective connection strengths in a simulated whole-brain network comprising 66 regions and 300 free parameters. Our results indicate that rDCM represents a computationally highly efficient approach with promising potential for inferring whole-brain connectivity from individual fMRI data.}

	abstract = {The structural connectome is a key determinant of brain function and dysfunction. The connectome-based model approach aims to understand the functional organization of the brain by modeling the brain as a dynamical system, then studying how the functional architecture rises from the underlying structural skeleton. Here, taking advantage of mice studies, we systematically investigated the informative content of different structural features in explaining the emergence of the functional ones. We demonstrate that individual variations define a specific structural fingerprint with a direct impact upon the functional organization of individual brains stressing the importance of using individualized models to understand brain function. We show how limitations of connectome reconstruction with the diffusion-MRI method restrict our comprehension of the structural{\textendash}functional relation.Whole brain dynamics intuitively depend upon the internal wiring of the brain; but to which extent the individual structural connectome constrains the corresponding functional connectome is unknown, even though its importance is uncontested. After acquiring structural data from individual mice, we virtualized their brain networks and simulated in silico functional MRI data. Theoretical results were validated against empirical awake functional MRI data obtained from the same mice. We demonstrate that individual structural connectomes predict the functional organization of individual brains. Using a virtual mouse brain derived from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, we further show that the dominant predictors of individual structure{\textendash}function relations are the asymmetry and the weights of the structural links. Model predictions were validated experimentally using tracer injections, identifying which missing connections (not measurable with diffusion MRI) are important for whole brain dynamics in the mouse. Individual variations thus define a specific structural fingerprint with direct impact upon the functional organization of individual brains, a key feature for personalized medicine.},

We introduce an organizing principle that leads to the first objective Taxonomy of Seizure Dynamics (TSD) based on bifurcation theory. The ‘dynamotype’ of a seizure is the dynamic composition that defines its observable characteristics, including how it starts, evolves and ends. Analyzing over 2000 focal-onset seizures from multiple centers, we find evidence of all 16 dynamotypes predicted in TSD. We demonstrate that patients’ dynamotypes evolve during their lifetime and display complex but systematic variations including hierarchy (certain types are more common), non-bijectivity (a patient may display multiple types) and pairing preference (multiple types may occur during one seizure). TSD provides a way to stratify patients in complement to present clinical classifications, a language to describe the most critical features of seizure dynamics, and a framework to guide future research focused on dynamical properties.},

    abstract = "{The identification of brain regions generating seizures (âepileptogenic zoneâ EZ) in patients with refractory partial epilepsy is crucial prior to surgery. During pre-surgical evaluation, this identification can be performed from the analysis of intracerebral EEG. In particular, the presence of high-frequency oscillations, often referred to as ârapid dischargesâ has long been recognized as a characteristic electrophysiological pattern of the EZ. However, to date, there has been no attempt to make use of this specific pattern to quantitatively evaluate the degree of epileptogenicity in recorded structures. A novel quantitative measure that characterizes the epileptogenicity of brain structures recorded with depth electrodes is presented. This measure, called âEpileptogenicity Indexâ(EI), is based on both spectral (appearance of fast oscillations replacing the background activity) and temporal (delay of appearance with respect to seizure onset) properties of intracerebral EEG signals. EI values were computed in mesial and lateral structures of the temporal lobe in a group of 17 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Statistically high EI values corresponded to structures involved early in the ictal process and producing rapid discharges at seizure onset. In all patients, these high values were obtained in more than one structure of the temporal lobe region. In the majority of patients, highest EI values were computed from signals recorded in mesial structures. In addition, when averaged over patients, EI values gradually decreased from structure to structure. For lateral neocortex, higher EI values were found in patients with normal MRI, in contrast with patients with hippocampal sclerosis. In this former sub-group of patients, a greater number of epileptogenic structures was also found. A statistically significant correlation was found between the duration of epilepsy and the number of structures disclosing high epileptogenicity suggesting that MTLE is a gradually evolving process in which the epileptogenicity of the temporal lobe tends to increase with time.}",

abstract = {Summary Epileptogenic networks are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. In this review we describe the historical, methodologic, and conceptual bases of this model in the analysis of electrophysiologic intracerebral recordings. In the context of epilepsy surgery, the determination of cerebral regions producing seizures (i.e., the “epileptogenic zone”) is a crucial objective. In contrast with a traditional focal vision of focal drug-resistant epilepsies, the concept of epileptogenic networks has been progressively introduced as a model better able to describe the complexity of seizure dynamics and realistically describe the distribution of epileptogenic anomalies in the brain. The concept of epileptogenic networks is historically linked to the development of the stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method and subsequent introduction of means of quantifying the recorded signals. Seizures, and preictal and interictal discharges produce clear patterns on SEEG. These patterns can be analyzed utilizing signal analysis methods that quantify high-frequency oscillations or changes in functional connectivity. Dramatic changes in SEEG brain connectivity can be described during seizure genesis and propagation within cortical and subcortical regions, associated with the production of different patterns of seizure semiology. The interictal state is characterized by networks generating abnormal activities (interictal spikes) and also by modified functional properties. The introduction of novel approaches to large-scale modeling of these networks offers new methods in the goal of better predicting the effects of epilepsy surgery. The epileptogenic network concept is a key factor in identifying the anatomic distribution of the epileptogenic process, which is particularly important in the context of epilepsy surgery.},

abstract = {Summary Objective Non¨Crapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is known to be a brain state associated with an activation of interictal epileptic activity. The goal of this work was to quantify topographic changes occurring during NREM sleep in comparison with wakefulness. Method We studied intracerebral recordings of 20 patients who underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) during presurgical evaluation for pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. We measured the number of interictal spikes (IS) and quantified the co-occurrence of IS between brain regions during 1 hour of NREM sleep and 1 hour of wakefulness. Co-occurrence is a method to estimate IS networks based on a temporal concordance between IS of different brain regions. Each studied region was labeled as ¡°seizure-onset zone¡± (SOZ), ¡°propagation zone¡± (PZ), or ¡°not involved region¡± (NIR). Results During NREM sleep, the number of interictal spikes significantly increased in all regions (mean of 68\%). This increase was higher in medial temporal regions than in other regions, whether involved in the SOZ. Spike co-occurrence increased significantly in all regions during NREM sleep in comparison with wakefulness but was greater in neocortical regions. Spike co-occurrence in medial temporal regions was not higher than in other regions, suggesting that the increase of the number of spikes in this region was in great part a local effect. Significance This study demonstrated that medial temporal regions show a greater propensity to spike production or propagation during NREM sleep compared to other brain regions, even when the medial temporal lobe is not involved in the SOZ.},

    abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

	abstract = {Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is a large-scale brain networks disorder characterized by altered spatiotemporal patterns of functional connectivity (FC), even during interictal resting state (RS). Although RS-FC-based metrics can detect these changes, results from RS functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies are unclear and difficult to interpret, and the underlying dynamical mechanisms are still largely unknown. To better capture the RS dynamics, we phenomenologically extended the neural mass model of partial seizures, the Epileptor, by including two neuron subpopulations of epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic type, making it capable of producing physiological oscillations in addition to the epileptiform activity. Using the neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain, we reconstructed 14 epileptic and 5 healthy human (of either sex) brain network models (BNMs), based on individual anatomical connectivity and clinically defined epileptogenic heatmaps. Through systematic parameter exploration and fitting to neuroimaging data, we demonstrated that epileptic brains during interictal RS are associated with lower global excitability induced by a shift in the working point of the model, indicating that epileptic brains operate closer to a stable equilibrium point than healthy brains. Moreover, we showed that functional networks are unaffected by interictal spikes, corroborating previous experimental findings; additionally, we observed higher excitability in epileptogenic regions, in agreement with the data. We shed light on new dynamical mechanisms responsible for altered RS-FC in epilepsy, involving the following two key factors: (1) a shift of excitability of the whole brain leading to increased stability; and (2) a locally increased excitability in the epileptogenic regions supporting the mixture of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity in these areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Advances in functional neuroimaging provide compelling evidence for epilepsy-related brain network alterations, even during the interictal resting state (RS). However, the dynamical mechanisms underlying these changes are still elusive. To identify local and network processes behind the RS-functional connectivity (FC) spatiotemporal patterns, we systematically manipulated the local excitability and the global coupling in the virtual human epileptic patient brain network models (BNMs), complemented by the analysis of the impact of interictal spikes and fitting to the neuroimaging data. Our results suggest that a global shift of the dynamic working point of the brain model, coupled with locally hyperexcitable node dynamics of the epileptogenic networks, provides a mechanistic explanation of the epileptic processes during the interictal RS period.

abstract = {The neurophysiological processes underlying non-invasive brain activity measurements are incompletely understood. Here, we developed a connectome-based brain network model that integrates individual structural and functional data with neural population dynamics to support multi-scale neurophysiological inference. Simulated populations were linked by structural connectivity and, as a novelty, driven by electroencephalography (EEG) source activity. Simulations not only predicted subjects' individual resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and spatial network topologies over 20 minutes of activity, but more importantly, they also revealed precise neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie and link six empirical observations from different scales and modalities: (1) resting-state fMRI oscillations, (2) functional connectivity networks, (3) excitation-inhibition balance, (4, 5) inverse relationships between α-rhythms, spike-firing and fMRI on short and long time scales, and (6) fMRI power-law scaling. These findings underscore the potential of this new modelling framework for general inference and integration of neurophysiological knowledge to complement empirical studies.},

	abstract = {Introduction Despite the success of epilepsy surgery, recent reports suggest a decline in surgical numbers. We tested these trends in our cohort to elucidate potential reasons.Patients and methods Presurgical, surgical and postsurgical data of all patients undergoing presurgical evaluation in between 1990 and 2013 were retrospectively analysed. Patients were grouped according to the underlying pathology.Results A total of 3060 patients were presurgically studied, and resective surgery was performed in 66.8\% (n=2044) of them: medial temporal sclerosis (MTS): n=675, 33.0\%; benign tumour (BT): n=408, 20.0\%; and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD): n=284, 13.9\%. Of these, 1929 patients (94.4\%) had a follow-up of 2 years, and 50.8\% were completely seizure free (Engel IA). Seizure freedom rate slightly improved over time. Presurgical evaluations continuously increased, whereas surgical interventions did not. Numbers for MTS, BT and temporal lobe resections decreased since 2009. The number of non-lesional patients and the need for intracranial recordings increased. More evaluated patients did not undergo surgery (more than 50\% in 2010{\textendash}2013) because patients were not suitable (mainly due to missing hypothesis: 4.5\% in 1990{\textendash}1993 up to 21.1\% in 2010{\textendash}2013, total 13.4\%) or declined from surgery (maximum 21.0\% in 2010{\textendash}2013, total 10.9\%). One potential reason may be that increasingly detailed information on chances and risks were given over time.Conclusions The increasing volume of the presurgical programme largely compensates for decreasing numbers of surgically remediable syndromes and a growing rate of informed choice against epilepsy surgery. Although comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is offered to a larger group of epilepsy patients, surgical numbers remain stable.},

abstract = {Abstract Generative models provide a well-established statistical framework for evaluating uncertainty and deriving conclusions from large data sets especially in the presence of noise, sparsity, and bias. Initially developed for computer vision and natural language processing, these models have been shown to effectively summarize the complexity that underlies many types of data and enable a range of applications including supervised learning tasks, such as assigning labels to images; unsupervised learning tasks, such as dimensionality reduction; and out-of-sample generation, such as de novo image synthesis. With this early success, the power of generative models is now being increasingly leveraged in molecular biology, with applications ranging from designing new molecules with properties of interest to identifying deleterious mutations in our genomes and to dissecting transcriptional variability between single cells. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the technical notions behind generative models and their implementation with deep learning techniques. We then describe several different ways in which these models can be utilized in practice, using several recent applications in molecular biology as examples.},

abstract = {Contemporary neuroscience has embraced network science and dynamical systems to study the complex and self-organized structure of the human brain. Despite the developments in non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, a full understanding of the directed interactions in whole brain networks, referred to as effective connectivity, as well as their role in the emergent brain dynamics is still lacking. The main reason is that estimating brain connectivity requires solving a formidable large-scale inverse problem from indirect and noisy measurements. Building on the dynamic causal modelling framework, the present study offers a novel method for estimating whole-brain effective connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance data. To this purpose sparse estimation methods are adapted to infer the parameters of our novel model, which is based on a linearized, region-specific haemodynamic response function. The resulting algorithm, referred to as sparse DCM, is shown to compare favorably with state-of-the art methods when tested on both synthetic and real data. We also provide a graph-theoretical analysis on the whole-brain effective connectivity estimated using data from a cohort of healthy individuals, which reveals properties such as asymmetry in the connectivity structure as well as the different roles of brain areas in favoring segregation or integration.}

abstract = {Metastability is a key source of itinerant dynamics in the brain; namely, spontaneous spatiotemporal reorganization of neuronal activity. This itinerancy has been the focus of numerous dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analyses – developed to characterize the formation and dissolution of distributed functional patterns over time, using resting state fMRI. However, aside from technical and practical controversies, these approaches cannot recover the neuronal mechanisms that underwrite itinerant (e.g., metastable) dynamics—due to their descriptive, model-free nature. We argue that effective connectivity (EC) analyses are more apt for investigating the neuronal basis of metastability. To this end, we appeal to biologically-grounded models (i.e., dynamic causal modelling, DCM) and dynamical systems theory (i.e., heteroclinic sequential dynamics) to create a probabilistic, generative model of haemodynamic fluctuations. This model generates trajectories in the parametric space of EC modes (i.e., states of connectivity) that characterize functional brain architectures. In brief, it extends an established spectral DCM, to generate functional connectivity data features that change over time. This foundational paper tries to establish the model’s face validity by simulating non-stationary fMRI time series and recovering key model parameters (i.e., transition probabilities among connectivity states and the parametric nature of these states) using variational Bayes. These data are further characterized using Bayesian model comparison (within and between subjects). Finally, we consider practical issues that attend applications and extensions of this scheme. Importantly, the scheme operates within a generic Bayesian framework – that can be adapted to study metastability and itinerant dynamics in any non-stationary time series.}

    abstract = "{Neuroimaging techniques are now widely used to study human cognition. The functional associations between brain areas have become a standard proxy to describe how cognitive processes are distributed across the brain network. Among the many analysis tools available, dynamic models of brain activity have been developed to overcome the limitations of original connectivity measures such as functional connectivity. This goes in line with the many efforts devoted to the assessment of directional interactions between brain areas from the observed neuroimaging activity. This opinion article provides an overview of our model-based whole-brain effective connectivity to analyze fMRI data, while discussing the pros and cons of our approach with respect to other established approaches. Our framework relies on the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process and is thus referred to as MOU-EC. Once tuned, the model provides a directed connectivity estimate that reflects the dynamical state of BOLD activity, which can be used to explore cognition. We illustrate this approach using two applications on task-evoked fMRI data. First, as a connectivity measure, MOU-EC can be used to extract biomarkers for task-specific brain coordination, understood as the patterns of areas exchanging information. The multivariate nature of connectivity measures raises several challenges for whole-brain analysis, for which machine-learning tools present some advantages over statistical testing. Second, we show how to interpret changes in MOU-EC connections in a collective and model-based manner, bridging with network analysis. Our framework provides a comprehensive set of tools that open exciting perspectives to study distributed cognition, as well as neuropathologies.Brain connectivity measures have been increasingly used to study cognition and neuropathologies with neuroimaging data. Many methods have been developed with particular objectives, in particular predictability to obtain biomarkers (i.e., which brain regions exhibit changes in their interactions across conditions) and interpretability (relating the connectivity measures back to the biology). In this article we present our framework for whole-brain effective connectivity that aims to find the equilibrium between these two desired properties, relying on a dynamic model that can be fitted to fMRI time series. Meanwhile, we compare it with previous work. Concretely, we show how machine learning can be used to extract biomarkers and how network-oriented analysis can be used to interpret the model estimates in terms of brain dynamics.}",

	abstract={Connectome-based models, also known as Virtual Brain Models (VBMs), have been well established in network neuroscience to investigate pathophysiological causes underlying a large range of brain diseases. The integration of an individual's brain imaging data in VBMs has improved patient-specific predictivity, although Bayesian estimation of spatially distributed parameters remains challenging even with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo sampling. VBMs imply latent nonlinear state space models driven by noise and network input, necessitating advanced probabilistic machine learning techniques for widely applicable Bayesian estimation. Here we present Simulation-based Inference on Virtual Brain Models (SBI-VBMs), and demonstrate that training deep neural networks on both spatio-temporal and functional features allows for accurate estimation of generative parameters in brain disorders. The systematic use of brain stimulation provides an effective remedy for the non-identifiability issue in estimating the degradation limited to smaller subset of connections. By prioritizing model structure over data, we show that the hierarchical structure in SBI-VBMs renders the inference more effective, precise and biologically plausible. This approach could broadly advance precision medicine by enabling fast and reliable prediction of patient-specific brain disorders.}
